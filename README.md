Create an application to have the following features
2. The user should be able to navigate to the following activities
a. Picture Activity
- to take a picture from the phone and show it in the ImageView.
b. EMI Activity

as we move it left and right. And calculate the EMI.
c. Person Activity
d. Person Result Activity
- have a user form to add person object and then pass the list of persons to the another activity to view all persons 
in a textview
e. At least 2 other activities
- Play with some widgets (Media Player, Web View, etc)
3. Add overflow menu (be creative with items in the menu) in the ActionBar of the app. 
Also add ActionItems on the ActionBar. (You can create different icons for each item)
